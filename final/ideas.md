# Ideas for the Final Project

1. Make the Zortrax follow your hand around. Outfit it with a camera instead
of a hand and make that hand hold the camera. Will require more computation
power like from a raspberry pi.
2. A [Hip ball](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/hip-ball-for-3d-printed-robot#documents)
printable robot.
3. An [Ada Robotic Hand](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ada-robotic-hand)
