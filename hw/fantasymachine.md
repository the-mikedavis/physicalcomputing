Simply add blue food coloring and a chicken to the incubator. Set the dial
to 400 and wait 3 hours. For more detailed timing, see the table:

Dial | Time (hrs) | Color
---- |:----------:| ----------
200  | 2          | White
200  | 3          | Teal
300  | 2          | Orange
300  | 3          | Red
300  | 4          | Yellow
400  | 2          | Green
400  | 3          | Blue
400  | 4          | Purple

Anything else and you'll end up with a very dead chicken.
