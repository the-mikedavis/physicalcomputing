# Zortrax Robotic Arm

Zortrax holds a number of 3D models for robots and manuals to help build them.
I want to build their flagship robotic arm, gear it up with motors, and get it
moving around. I also want to create an interface to control the arm from a
computer and possibly, with human input. Imagine that a human could control the
arm with their arm. This could be pretty fun.

The Neurosky MindWave is an EEG headset. It essentially reads brain activity.
Another (perhaps optimistic) route for controlling the arm may be to use EEG.
If the readings are consistent enough, it may be possible to create an
interface to control the robot through thought. In the past few years,
Neurosky has open sourced their code for the MindWave, making it possible for
makers to grab ahold of it and do some pretty cool things.

Check out [this project](http://hex-machina.com/hw/mindbullets), where a maker
used a MindWave to control a NERF gun.

For basic testing and control, I intend to hook up a motor or two to some
potentiometers and buttons to show what kind of precision I have in the
control.

## Buliding it

Building the arm will require some intermediate wiring skills, mostly involving
using stepper motors with motor sheilds, as well as some 3D printing skills.
The arm can't really be bought (or at least, that's not the intention). All the
3D models exist and are ready to be printed by the maker themself.

Here's a list of the parts (most of which are already printed).

- [x] Arm-1-gear
- [x] Arm-1-lower
- [x] Arm-2
- [x] Arm-3
- [x] Base-gear
- [x] Side-cover-arm-L
- [x] Side-cover-arm-R
- [x] Side-cover-base-L
- [x] Side-cover-base-R
- [x] Side-lid-arm-L
- [x] Side-lid-arm-R
- [x] Small-gear
- [x] Support
- [x] Toothed-ring
- [x] Vertical-axis-gear
- [ ] Arm-1-upper
- [ ] Base (reprint with water-soluble method)
- [ ] Grasper-1
- [ ] Grasper-2
- [ ] Grasper-body
- [ ] Grasper-holder
- [ ] Ring (possibly reprint)

Those are just the 3D printable parts. Then the builder needs some electronic
parts like Nema 17 motors. To see the other parts, check out the
[manual](http://www.zortrax.com/downloads/ROBOTIC_MANUAL.pdf).
